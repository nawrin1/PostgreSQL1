## Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL. :old_key:
- Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a group of columns used to uniquely identify a row in a table. A table can have zero or one primary key. It cannot have more than one primary key. A primary key constraint is the combination of a not-null constraint and a UNIQUE constraint.

- Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. A foreign key establishes a link between the data in two tables by referencing the primary key or a unique constraint of the referenced table.
